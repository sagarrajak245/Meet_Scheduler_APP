### How to Use the Script

You only need to do this once.

**Step 1: Make the Script Executable**
Open your terminal (like Git Bash on Windows, which it looks like you are using) and run this command:
```bash
chmod +x build_and_log.sh
```
This command gives your computer permission to run the file as a program.

**Step 2: Run the Script**
Now, instead of running `npm run build`, you will run your new script:
```bash
./build_and_log.sh
